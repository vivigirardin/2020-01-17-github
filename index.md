# Writing and Coding Together on the Web Using GitHub

**About the Workshop**

This workshop introduces you to GitHub, a widely used platform for developing, 
managing and storing code and documentation. Starting out as a remote hub for developers all over the world,
GitHub is now home to a growing number of research and other academic projects that
want to collaborate accross institutional and national borders and share their code and software for data analysis - 
alongside documentation as well as notes and project reports.

**Who is this workshop for?**

Whether you are a research software engineer with years of practice, a researcher collaborating in an
international project, a gradute student working on their thesis or a specialist in the library, archive 
and museum sector - if you are creating code, texts, or databases, if you are collaborating, and if you 
want your work to be shared openly, this workshop is for you!

You will learn how to set up a profile on GitHub, how to create a repository and add files to it.
You will learn about licenses and which ones apply best to your projects.
You will learn about version controll, how to work together in a shared folder, and how to manage and 
review changes in files.
You will learn how to collaborate online with colleagues - and strangers.
You will learn how to create a simple website for your project.

**What do you need to bring?**

You must bring a laptop or a tablet with wifi enabled.

**Do I need to be a software developer?**

No! To get use out of this workshop, you don't need to know any programming language or do any coding.
We will work with text files only.
